She very well recognizes a student's potential, what he is capable of. Even I wasn't as sure as Deep Maam was that I would crack IITJEE.

                        She is of a very genuine caring nature who effortlessly understands her pupils and tries to help in anyway possible way she can. She is one of those people I know personally, who wants to make a difference in people's lives just by doing her bit.</p>
